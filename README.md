# Framework7 - Twitter Dark Mode
## About
A complete redesign of the Framework7 Dark Mode to look like the twitter dark mode!
## How to Install
This installation progress is really simple. add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S0n1cDev/TDM/master/Framework7-TwitterDarkMode.css">` before `<head>` ends. then add `class="layout-TDM"` to `<body>`. and it would show the new theme on your app!
